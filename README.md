# ChatProject
Chat / task management app using Angular and Sockets

# Current
Adding backend routes for storage of data, and for retrieving data on login. Sockets handles all data while user retrieval while user is logged in but data needs to be stored so the correct data can be retrieved on next login.

# Done
Sockets currently working. Allows messags, tasks, and notifications to be sent, and allows contacts to be added and groups to be created.
